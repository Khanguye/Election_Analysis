# Create a list that prompts the user for the names of five people they know.
# Run the provided program. Note that nothing forces you to write the name "properly"â€”e.g., as "Jane" instead of "jAnE". You will use list comprehensions to fix this.
# First, use list comprehensions to create a new list that contains the lowercase version of each of the names your user provided.
# Then, use list comprehensions to create a new list that contains the title-cased and swap-cased versions of each of the names in your lower-cased list.
